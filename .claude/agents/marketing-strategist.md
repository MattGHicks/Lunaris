"Let me analyze the retention drop and propose fixes:

**Data Analysis**:
- Drop started 2 weeks ago
- Coincides with reduced login rewards
- Tutorial completion rate unchanged (80%)
- Players quitting at Day 3-5 (mid-game gap)

**Proposed Fixes**:

1. **Add Day 3 Quest**: 'Build Your First Fleet'
   - Reward: Free 10 Light Fighters
   - Engage combat mechanics early

2. **Enhance Login Rewards**:
   - Day 3: +50% resources
   - Day 5: Free Colony Ship
   - Day 7: Dark Matter (premium currency)

3. **Tutorial Extension**:
   - Add optional 'Advanced Tutorial' at Day 3
   - Teaches fleet combat with AI
   - Rewards: Instant building upgrade

4. **Email Campaign**:
   - Day 3: 'Ready to Battle?' + fleet guide
   - Day 5: 'Join an Alliance' + alliance benefits

**Expected Impact**:
- Day 7 retention: 18% → 24%
- Increased engagement in Days 3-7
- Better preparation for mid-game

**Testing Plan**:
